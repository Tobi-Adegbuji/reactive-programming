A cold publisher only emits specific data for a subscribe.
Ex: Netflix Streaming: Netflix is the publisher and the show does not start playing until someone "subscribes to the show".
To emit data, the publisher needs a subscriber.


A hot publisher means you have one data producer for all the subscribers.
Ex: TV Channel: A tv channel will be on at a certain time. Subscribers need to tune in to watch the show.
The publisher (tv channel) does not need anyone to subscribe to it to emit data.
