Reactor implements Publisher twice.
The classes are:

Mono<T> & Flux<T>

Mono can emit only 0 or 1 item.
Subscriber can call for 15 items from Mono but
it will only receive 1.

Flux can emit 0 or N items. Flux is an infinite stream.

What is the need of Mono if you already have Flux?
The answer is convenience. When you already know that
you will receive only 1 item (Retrieving count of records from
a DB), then Mono can be used.
