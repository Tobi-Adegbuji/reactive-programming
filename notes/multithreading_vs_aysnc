From the definitions we just provided, we can see that
multithreading programming is all about concurrent execution of different functions.
Async programming is about non-blocking execution between functions,
and we can apply async with single-threaded or multithreaded programming.

So, multithreading is one form of asynchronous programming.

Again, async can be applied with multi-threaded programs OR single -threaded.
